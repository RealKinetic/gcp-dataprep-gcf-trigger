# gcp-dataprep-gcf-trigger

Trigger a Dataprep job when a file is uploaded to Cloud Storage using a Cloud
Function.

For triggering Dataprep flows using Dataflow templates directly rather than
the Dataprep API, see
[gcp-dataflow-gcf-trigger](https://github.com/RealKinetic/gcp-dataflow-gcf-trigger).
